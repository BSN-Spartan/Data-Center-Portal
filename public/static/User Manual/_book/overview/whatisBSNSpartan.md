---

" A blockchain is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called blocks, which are securely linked together using cryptography. 
"

Blockchain technology was used to build digital ledgers when it was first invented, but with the continuous upgrading and iteration of the technology, various innovative applications based on blockchain continue to emerge, and NFTs are one of the most common applications. The emergence of NFTs clearly tells the world that the potential of blockchain technology is far more than a small ledger, but a new generation of data management system that could replace traditional databases. For a healthy and secure blockchain system, the data on the chain cannot be secretly tampered with, nor can it be accidentally deleted. Users can easily verify the data's authenticity and accuracy, which greatly reduces the cost of communication, increases trust and improves the efficiency of data use. In addition, in our opinion, blockchain will also become a pivotal technology to promote the evolution of traditional private IT systems to new public IT systems.

A Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chain is a transformed public chain framework based on an existing public chain. Gas Credit transfers are not permitted between standard wallets. There are no cryptocurrency incentives for mining or participating in consensus.

<br/>

## <font color=Black><span id="1.4">What is a Wallet</span></font>

Wallet refers to the wallet address or smart contract address of an NC Public Chain on the BSN Spartan Network, which can be generated arbitrarily by users. The wallets are used to hold non-transferable Gas Credits.

## <font color=Black><span id="1.5">Full Node & Consensus Node</span></font>
---

- **Full Nodes:** A Full Node on a NC Public Chain does not participate in consensus. Upon registering a Full Node on the BSN Spartan Network, it synchronizes all data on the specific chain. The data center to which the Full Node belongs will receive relevant incentives under the Node Establishment Incentive Program.

- **Consensus/Validator Nodes:** Nodes are used for proposing new blocks and voting for consensus mechanisms on NC Public Chains. Consensus Nodes can only be installed on Governance Data Centers operated by BSN Foundation members.
