# <font color=Black>Information on the Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains</font>

A Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chain is a transformed public chain framework based on an existing public chain. Gas Credit transfers are not permitted between standard wallets. There are no cryptocurrency incentives for mining or participating in consensus. On Spartan Network, there are three Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains at launch. We expect to add more in the foreseeable future.

### <font color=Black><span id="1.1">About Spartan-I Chain (Powered by NC Ethereum)</span></font> 

The Spartan-I Chain is a blockchain compatible with Ethereum that runs independently from the public Ethereum blockchain. Full Nodes, which can freely join and exit the Spartan Network, synchronize block information of the entire chain and submit transaction requests to the network.

A Spartan-I full node runs an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that allows developers to use Solidity programming language to create smart contracts that are compatible with the Ethereum network. Also, all the different tools and wallets available for Ethereum (such as Truffle, HardHat, Metamask, etcâ€¦) can be directly used with Spartan-I Chain.

Ethereum-based networks have two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the same value, they have different uses. Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the network ID, while the transaction signature process uses the chain ID.

**Spartan-I Chain Network Id = Chain Id = 9090**

### <font color=Black><span id="2.1">About Spartan-II Chain (Powered by NC Cosmos)</span></font> 

The Spartan-II Chain is a Cosmos-based network which has two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the same value, they have different uses. Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the network ID, while the transaction signature process uses the chain ID.

**EVM module: Network ID = Chain ID = 9003**

**Native module: Network ID = Chain Id = starmint**
