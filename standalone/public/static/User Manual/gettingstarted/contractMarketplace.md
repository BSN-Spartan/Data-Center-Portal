They provide some most basic and common functions and methods of blockchain smart contracts. Developers can directly call these smart contracts without rebuilding similar functions again. Most of these smart contracts are open source. BSN official contract services are default listed in all data center end-user portals and integrated into the data center APIs/SDKs for easy access.
