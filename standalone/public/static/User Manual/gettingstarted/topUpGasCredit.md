# <font color=Black>Top Up Gas Credit</font>

 
Any Wallet in the Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains must consume Gas Credit when initiating a transaction. For example, if a user wants to initiate a transaction, the userâ€™s Wallet needs to consume Gas Credit. At this time, users must use fiat currency or USDC to top up the Gas Credit of the Wallet to ensure that the transaction can proceed normally.
